Geode Initializer is a straightforward utility designed to download files and repositories from GitHub and facilitate the installation of the Geode SDK and CLI. It offers a convenient setup process for Geode, minimizing any associated complexities.

## IMPORTANT NOTICE:
Geode Initializer is offline due to a minor bug ("quasi-Jkon") within the Geode system. While this bug does not directly impact Geode functionality, it does affect certain aspects of the code, resulting in improper functioning. This is being worked on and will be fixed as soon as possible.
